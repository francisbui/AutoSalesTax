# Automotive Sales Tax Converter
 The purpose of this program is to compute the sales tax for a collection of automobiles of different types. It will implement four classes including a GUI that will allow the user to input the specified data of the automobile, then based on that information, compute the corresponding sales tax based on the appropriate vehicle type (electric, hybrid, other). The program will produce a report on the automobiles, that is stored in an array, to the console displaying the attributes of the vehicle and then calculations made.
